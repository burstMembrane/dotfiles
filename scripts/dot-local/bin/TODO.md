# TODO: Scripts

These scripts are common convenience functions to fuzzy find or optimize common processes

- [x] Read documentation in the terminal -- find git repo -> git ls-remote HEAD <repo-url> -> filter MD files -> pick files (with preview)
- [x] Preview git diffs in the terminal using delta
- [x] Quick render docs (html) in the terminal
- [ ] Clean up git branches with fzf
- [ ] Spin up a browser window or webview in a tmux popup or nvim popup (is this possible?)
